# Dockblock Format Helper package

Helps format JS and PHP docblocks so that it is less work to write them.

```
/**
 * short description
 *
 * @return type description
 */
 ```

When writing a docblock It will automatically when you start a docblock by
typing '/\*\*'. It will detect you are in a docblock and add the '\*' characters
for you. And it will know when you hit return after the '\*/' of your docblock
and remove the extra space from your indentation.
